### Hi there 👋🏼

- 🧑🏼‍🎓 I’m a postdoc researcher at MIT CSAIL.
- 🤓 I'm building photonic computer systems that outperform existing systems by orders of magnitude promised by the fundamental law of physics. As a CS postdoc with an EE PhD background, my career has been at the crossroads of Networked Computer Systems and Applied Optics/Photonics to build the next-generation [reconfigurable computer networks](http://reconfignets.csail.mit.edu/) and [high-performance computing infrastructures](https://lightning.mit.edu/).
- ⚡ Most recently, I've been building [Lightning](https://lightning.mit.edu/), a photonic-electronic deep learning smartNIC that serves real-time inference requests at a record-breaking 4.055 GHz compute frequency. 
- ⚙️ In the past, I have worked on photonic-electronic systems like [FlexWAN](https://people.csail.mit.edu/zhizhenzhong/papers/2023_SIGCOMM_flexwan.pdf) (SIGCOMM 2023), [TopoOpt](https://people.csail.mit.edu/zhizhenzhong/papers/2023_NSDI_TopoOpt.pdf) (NSDI 2023), [NetCast](https://people.csail.mit.edu/zhizhenzhong/papers/2022_Science_netcast.pdf) (Science 2022), [ARROW](http://people.csail.mit.edu/zhizhenzhong/papers/2021_SIGCOMM_ARROW.pdf) (SIGCOMM 2021), [BOW](http://people.csail.mit.edu/zhizhenzhong/papers/2021_OFCPDP_BOW.pdf) (OFC 2021 postdeadline), [Facebook RSS](http://people.csail.mit.edu/zhizhenzhong/papers/2021_NSDI_covidbackbone.pdf) (NSDI 2021) and [LPSplitting](http://people.csail.mit.edu/zhizhenzhong/papers/2019_ToN_LPSplitting.pdf) (ToN 2019).
